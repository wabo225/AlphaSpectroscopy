## Alpha Spectroscopy

1. Adjust the distance between the source stage and the silicon detector to be somewhat larger than 3.5 cm. 

To do this I had to evacuate the chamber with two valves and wait for it to equalize ~$745$ torr. While it was open I measured

| Implement | Length (mm) |
| --- | --- |
| Detector | $14\pm 2$ |
| Source | $54 \pm 2$ |
| Detector diameter | $13 \pm 0.5 mm$ |

2. Apply $+30V$ to the detector bias over the course of 60s, connect the energy line to the oscilloscope. I had to adjust the trigger to see anything. 

Directly from the preamplifier, the oscilloscope creates peaks of heigh less than $100mV$, with a width of $~100\micro s$.

These are the peaks that I should replicate using the function generator. 

3. Using the amplifier, and a course shaping of $6\micro s$ the peaks look gaussian. I forgot to measure the width. I should probably look at the FWHM
